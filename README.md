# CodeCapture
Xamarin.Forms app for CodeCapture

In its current state, the app extracts text from any image captured or selected using the Azure Computer Vision Read API, displays it in an in-app text editor for any corrections, compiles it using the JDoodle API (Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript) and then allows the app to email it to any email address of the user's preference.
